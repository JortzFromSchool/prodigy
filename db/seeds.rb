description1 = "The track is a perfect example of Daft Punk’s sound at it’s most accessible: a post-disco boogie bassline, a minimalist sprinkling of synthetic keyboard melody and a single, naggingly insistent hook. While the vocal performs that role on “Around the World,” elsewhere the same effect is achieved using a wide variety of sounds."
