# Technologies
* Prodigy is built with Ruby on Rails
* Prodigy is built with React components and React-Redux bindings for component updating and extracting values.
* Prodigy uses AWS S3 storage for media files.

# Features
* Prodigy creates annotations by grabbing highlighted lyric text on the page. This is handled with a onMouseUp html attribute and an accompanying modal:

* onMouseUp ensures that the modal is only called when text is highlighted on the page.
